<h2>What is CookieJar?</h2>
<p>CookieJar is a project that was created in Fall 2015 and Winter 2016 by a group of students as part of their senior capstone comprehensive exercise.</p>
<p>CookieJar is a Chrome Extension that allows you to keep tabs on your cookies as they are created and remove undesired cookies without interrupting your browsing. Our goal was easy tracking and visualizing of cookies to streamline user control of their online presence.</p>

    <h3>Cody Bohlman</h3>
    <img src="icon.png" style="width:100px;height:100px;">
    <p>Bio Goes here</p> 
    <h3>Emma Freeman</h3>
    <img src="emmaphoto.png" style="width:400px;height:250px;">
    <p>Emma is from Greenwich, Connecticut and majors in Computer Science with a concentration in Women and Gender Studies. During her time at Carleton College, she has participated in various forms of feminist activism, worked for the Alumni Relations department and the Computer Science department, and sporadically played intramural soccer. After graduating this winter, she will be traveling in Europe before starting her job at Fidelity Investments in the fall.</p>  
    <h3>Joy Hill</h3>

    <h3>Sahree Kasper</h3>
    <img src="sahreephoto.jpg"  style="width:400px;height:293px;">
    <p>Sahree was born and raised in the great town of Northfield, Minnesota. Although she meant to escape the cold clutches of Minnesota and break her Malt-O-Meal cereal addiction, attending Carleton College happened to be a dream come true. With a Computer Science major and a Russian language certificate, she is perfect hacker material. Thankfully, she definitely does not know how to hack. Yet. Next year she will be a software engineer at United Health Group.</p> 
    <h3>Robert Krossa</h3>
    <img src="robertphoto.jpg"  style="width:325px;height:325px;">
    <p>Robert is a Computer Science and Economics double major from Seattle, Washington. As a four-year member of the Varsity Swimming & Diving Team at Carleton, he has definitely kept busy. Next year, Robert plans on tackling Silicon Valley, where he will be working as a Software Developer for Amazon. </p>
